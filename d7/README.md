**Day 7: Looping**

1. Looping
   - For loops and while loops.
     ```python
     for i in range(5):
         print(i)
         
     x = 0
     while x < 5:
         print(x)
         x += 1
     ```
Assignments:
1. Use a for loop to print the numbers 1 to 10.
2. Use a while loop to print the numbers from 10 to 1 in descending order
