**Day 3: Strings and Number Operations**

1. Strings
   - Concatenation, indexing, and slicing.
     ```python
     greeting = "Hello"
     name = "Python"
     message = greeting + ", " + name + "!"
     print(message)
     ```
2. Number Operations
   - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation.
     ```python
     x = 10
     y = 20
     print(x + y)
     print(x - y)
     print(x * y)
     print(x / y)
     print(x ** y)
     ```
Assignments:
1. Concatenate two strings and print the result.
2. Perform different arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers.
