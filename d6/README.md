**Day 6: Conditional Statements**

1. Conditional Statements
   - Using if, elif, and else to control program flow.
     ```python
     x = 10
     if x > 0:
         print("Positive")
     elif x < 0:
         print("Negative")
     else:
         print("Zero")
     ```
Assignments:
1. Write a program that checks if a number is positive, negative or zero.
2. Write a program that takes in a grade (0-100). If it's 90 or above, it's an A. 80-89 is a B. 70-79 is a C. 60-69 is a D. Anything below 60 is an F.
